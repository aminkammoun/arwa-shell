# Simple Shell

This is a basic implementation of a shell written in C.

## Features

-   Can execute basic commands such as `ls`, `pwd`, `echo`, etc.
-   Can handle command arguments and flags.
-   Can handle multiple commands on one line separated by `;`.
-   Can handle standard input and output redirection using `>` and `<`.
-   Can handle background processes using `&`.

## How to use

-   Compile the code using `gcc shell.c -o shell`.
-   Run the compiled binary using `./shell`.
-   The shell prompt will appear, and you can enter commands as you would in a regular shell.

## Limitations

-   Does not handle pipes (`|`) or environment variables.
-   Only supports a limited number of built-in commands.
-   Error handling is minimal.

## Future Improvements

-   Add support for pipes and environment variables.
-   Improve error handling.
-   Add more built-in commands.
-   Add support for command history and tab completion.
